Title: "I built a minimal React component for multiline text truncation - zero dependencies, TypeScript support, fully accessible"

Hey r/reactjs! 👋

I've been working on a common UI problem and wanted to share my solution with the community.

**react-text-ellipsis-clamp** is a lightweight React component that handles multiline text truncation using CSS-only line-clamp. No JavaScript calculations, no external dependencies, just clean CSS.

**Why I built this:**
- Most existing solutions are either too heavy or lack accessibility features
- Wanted something that works out of the box with modern React patterns
- Needed TypeScript support for better DX

**Key features:**
- 🎯 CSS-only solution (performance optimized)
- ♿ Full accessibility support (ARIA attributes, keyboard nav)
- 🎨 Highly customizable (any HTML element, custom styling)
- 📱 Responsive design
- 🔧 TypeScript definitions included
- 📦 Zero dependencies

**Live demo:** https://ytahirkose.github.io/react-text-ellipsis-clamp/
**NPM:** npm i react-text-ellipsis-clamp
**GitHub:** https://github.com/ytahirkose/react-text-ellipsis-clamp

Would love to get your feedback! What features would you like to see added?

*Edit: Thanks for the gold! 🙏 Really appreciate the community support.*
